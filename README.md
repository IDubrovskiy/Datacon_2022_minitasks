 Different ML algorithms to determine nanoparticles' catalytic activity
 This project presents the use of several machine learning models on a database containing various parameters related to nanoparticles.
 The database is extended with several new descriptors that are created based on nanoparticle characteristics. 
 Several machine learning models were used, namely Gradient boosting regression, Elastic net and Random forest.
 These models are optimized using Bayesian optimization, and feature importance is shown for each of them.
 Each model was used to predict the catalytic activity of the particles, namely the catalytic rate constant and the Michaelis-Menten constant.
